# exercism-python-solutions
This is a collection of solutions to coding exercises which I made for my own personal use, but which I decided to make publicly available for whomever wishes to view or use them.

Each exercise has its own separate folder.
Inside each folder is:  
\<FOLDER NAME\>.py, which contains my solution to the problem,  
\<FOLDER NAME\>\_test.py, which is a test suite for that solution,  
a \_\_pycache\_\_ folder, which contains helper code for that test suite,  
and a README.md file, explaining what the problem is.  

Only \<FOLDER NAME\>.py is my original work. 
All other files were created by those who work on www.exercism.com.
Should anybody object to my rehosting of these files, I am happy to amend this repository as they wish.

All of these files date from June to August of 2020.
