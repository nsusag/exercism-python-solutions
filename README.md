# exercism-python-solutions
A collection of solutions to coding problems on exercism.com in Python 3

This is a collection of solutions I created for personal use, but which I decided to make publicly available for whomever wishes to view or use them.
Each problem has its own separate folder.
Inside each folder is:
\<FOLDER NAME\>.py, which contains my solution to the problem,
\<FOLDER NAME\>\_test.py, which is a test suite for that solution,
a \_\_pycache\_\_ folder, which contains helper code for that test suite,
and a README.md file, explaining what the problem is.

Only \<FOLDER NAME\>.py is my original work. 
All other files were created by exercism.
Should anybody object to my rehosting of these files, I am happy to amend this repository as they wish
All of these files date from June to August of 2020.
